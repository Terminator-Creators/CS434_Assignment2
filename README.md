# CS434_Assignment2
Movie classification implementation for CS434

Each problem in the assignment is self-contained in the .py file of it's problem number (ex: prob3.py gives the output for #3)

## Packages:
  To run this code, the following packages need to be installed for python3:
    1. pandas
    2. sklearn.feature_extraction.text
    3. re
    4. math
    5. time
    6. numpy
    7. csv
    8. matplotlib.pyplot

## How to run:
  1. N/A (no need to run)
  2. python3 prob2.py
  3. python3 prob3.py
  4. python3 prob4.py*
  5. python3 prob5.py
  
  * prob4.py sometimes throws errors on saving the .png because of font paths, but from what I could tell it still outputs the .png and       the .csv file of predictions.
